        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Plot is the sequence of events that occurs in a story. There is a significant difference between story and plot, in that story represents plot in its own way. Plot always follows a series of cause and events. A -&gt; B that usually goes across a serial linear time. So A happens, then B happens, then C happens, etc.</p>

<p>A plot hole occurs when there is a break in the logic from A -&gt; B. For example, Steven goes to Germany in Chapter 1, but is in Belgium in Chapter 2 without explanation.</p>

<p>A plot is composed of multiple threads, which contain a line of actions that follow a thread-anchor. A thread-anchor ties the threads together. For example, in the hobbit, it was Bilbo Baggins that tied the thread together throughout the whole book I think, but in the Lord of the Rings, multiple threads follow multiple characters, with threads starting, merging, and ending based on the fates of those characters.</p>

<p>So the thread can follow a few things: 
	+ A single character
	+ A group of characters
	+ A setting</p>

<p>An object is not usually a thread-anchor, and when it is, it tends to act its own personified character, like the lyrics in Nas’s “I Gave You Power”</p>

<p>It leads to interesting situations, however. In the LOTR films, were Isildur’s scenes anchor to Isildur or the ring?</p>

<h2 id="observer-plot-threads">Observer Plot-Threads</h2>

<p>To solve this question, we further atomize the plot-thread to the observer thread. An observer thread is the plot-thread taken from the perspective of a single object/character.</p>

<p>So we take the perspective of Isildur’s scenes into two observers: the ring and Isildur. Each have their own stories, whereupon the ring’s thread extends far past Isildur’s thread, entering Gollum’s thread, and Bilbo’s thread, and so forth.</p>

<p>However, it also includes all the small things, like the horses, and the river, and the arrows, and anything mentioned or shown.</p>

<p>In a different scene, any cup that a character drank from has an observer thread. That would document the time it was given to them, picked up, drank from, and set aside. It technically dies there, but we can imagine it’s returned to the tavern keep where it’s cleaned. Any sword they used to fight, and so forth.</p>

<p>Multiple observer threads interact together to create a scene. The character drinks the cup, is composed of two observer threads interacting, such that from the cup’s observation: “The character drank from me.” and from the character’s observation: “I drink from the cup.”</p>

<p>Likewise, a location can also be an observer thread.</p>

<h3 id="plot-points">Plot Points</h3>

<p>A plot point happens when there is a change indicated towards the observer thread. If a character says something in a dialogue, that is a plot point. However, when a different character says something, the observer thread continues, but ceases any instance of action, until they do something like scratch their nose, or hiccup, or reply.</p>

<p>What happens between plot-points is often inferred, and it’s usually that between plot point A and plot point B that when something happens that breaks the assumption, it can become a surprise, or a plot hole in the case of an unintended surprise.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of subtle one:</p>

<p>1.A+C: A puts down C.
2.A: A puts up his hands.
3.A+C: A sips from C</p>

<p>It creates a small plot hole, since 3.A+C presumes that A is still holding the cup.</p>

<p>One could imagine there might be a bit of wiggle room, since the character can sip the cup without holding the cup if the imagined cup is topped out, which can be assumed if it’s right after the server has given it to the character, if not outright said. However, that is the domain of the story and not the plot. The plot <em>should</em> be as unassuming as possible.</p>

<p>So to correct the subtle plot hole, we’d have to fill in the blanks:</p>

<p>1.A+C: 	A puts down C.
2.A: 	A puts up hands.
3.A: 	A grabs C.
4.A+C:	A sips from C.</p>

<p>If something remains static, either in movement (a car) or in activity, or in such, then it’s inferred that it remains as such until ended.</p>

<h2 id="location-set-thread">Location (Set) Thread</h2>

<p>There is such a thing as a location thread, which is pretty much analagous to a mathematical set. We keep the name “element” for an observer inside a location.</p>

<p>A location becomes an element if no observer threads are within it and it’s referenced. A thing becomes a location if observer threads are within it and it’s referenced. (Spatially)</p>

<p>If I’m inside a tavern during a scene, then the tavern is a location. However, if I’m outside in the street, and I refer to the tavern, or if I’m going to the tavern, then the tavern is also a (sister) element.</p>

<p>A location is an observer thread, with the potential to hold observer threads within it.</p>

<h3 id="universal-location">Universal Location</h3>

<p>Location threads are rather pervasive. If a story takes place in a city, then the location anchors almost all the observer threads of the story. And from there, it grows out from country to continent, to world, etc.</p>

<p>This cascade is reduced to the “universal” thread. The universal thread is the the location thread that contains all occurences within the story.</p>

<h2 id="link-threads">Link Threads</h2>

<p>Def. For all x,y,z that belong to the set of observer threads, x is a link between y and z if x intersects both y and z threads. x != y, x != z.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this series of plot points (using location notation):</p>

<p>1: L(-A) 
2: L(+B)
3: L(+A,B)</p>

<p>Legend:</p>

<p>Point 1: Character A left location L.
Point 2: Character B entered location L.
Point 3: Character A entered location L.</p>

<p>In this previous example, L links A and B.</p>

<h2 id="starts-and-ends-of-threads">Starts and Ends of Threads</h2>

<p>The start and end of a thread relies on its location. A anchors location L1 and L2 if it crosses them. Let’s say that A goes from the tavern hall to the bedroom.</p>

<p>They are technically still contained within the tavern thread.</p>

<h2 id="narrative-thread">Narrative Thread</h2>

<p>We introduce then the concept of the narrative thread, which is the thread of whats written or shown in the story. The narrative thread is not necessary for plot points to occur, as these plot points occur “off screen”, but the narrative thread is necessary for a plot-point <em>to exist</em> for the reader.</p>

<p>So the narrative thread is quite unique in being alive. It transcends the universal location of the plotline in its ability to explain things that exist and don’t exist.</p>

<p>To understand why, the narrative thread is the thread that constructs the plotline. While things can happen before the official narrative, it occurs during exposition.</p>

<p>The start and end of an observer thread is as the narrative thread moves locations.</p>

<p>If the narrative thread moves from L1 to L2, anything that hasn’t moved from L1 to L2 terminates there, and starts again when they appear in a new location, or they appear in the new thread.</p>

<h1 id="applying-the-theory">Applying the Theory</h1>

<p>It’s mostly a method of analysis and construction for now, but I want to use it to see why plots of certain stories are good.</p>
