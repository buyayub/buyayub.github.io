field:
  - id: "computer_science"
    name: "Computer Science"
    description: "Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, information theory, and automation) to practical disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). Computer science is generally considered an area of academic research and distinct from computer programming."

    name: "Coding Theory"
    alias:
      - "Algebraic Coding Theory"
    description: "Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their respective fitness for specific applications. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, data transmission and data storage."
